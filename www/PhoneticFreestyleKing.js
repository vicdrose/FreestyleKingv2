/*There needs to be a better way to develop web software!!
You should simply be able to make your html first then your javascript
should show you what you have already added to the html so you can move stuff
Then you should have to modify the CSS last
*/

//There probably is something like this already

//I could probably use a visual thing lke Wordpress then do the custom Javascript...Duh
//That will be SICK!

/*
What a concept...it will have to go in iterations...HTML & Javascript first
THEN Make the Wordpress version. Make a wordpress version of FreestyleKing.
Use custom Javascript for the functionality. Done.

/*

/*
